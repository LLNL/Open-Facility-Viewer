# Open-Facility-Viewer
Open Facility Viewer (OFV) is an application for 3D interactive walk-throughs of facilities

OFV will not run without a "data/ProjectAssets" directory containing a valid Delta3D map file (*.dtmap)

Currently you must provide this. There are many examples in the Delta3D project.
